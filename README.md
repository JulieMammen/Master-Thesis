# Modernizing Cancer Registry Data with FHIR mCODE

## Project Overview
This project evaluates the transformation of NAACCR-based cancer registry data
(Breast and Prostate cancer) into HL7 FHIR mCODE representations to support
longitudinal analytics, semantic interoperability, and extensibility.

## Clinical  Source
NAACCR abstracted cancer registry data.

## Scope
- Breast and Prostate cancer
- Diagnosis + longitudinal treatment and outcomes
- Comparative analysis: Registry vs mCODE

## Status
Week 1: Crosswalk development (NAACCR → mCODE)
